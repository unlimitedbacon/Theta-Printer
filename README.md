Whats a polar printer?
----------------------
A polar printer works kind of like an old fashioned record player. Your objects are printed onto a platter which spins. The advantage is that you can have many print heads. Each extruder is on the end of an arm which swings in and out. The spinning platter is called the ϴ ("theta") axis and the swinging arm is called the R axis. Together these replace the normal X and Y coordinates you're used to.

Features
--------
+ 4 extruders for multiple colors and materials
+ 320 mm build platter
+ 80425 mm^2 print area (bigger than most repraps)
+ 0.084 degrees/step angular resolution (ϴ Axis)
+ 0.20 mm/step linear resolution (R Axis)
+ Now comes in two versions! The lasercut edition and the reprap edition (printed parts & threaded rods)

ϴ Axis

Objects are printed onto a platter that spins back and forth. Its driven via a stepper motor and a large gear. Rollers support the platter around the perimeter and keep it level.

R Axis

Four Extruders are each mounted on the end of an arm that swings in and out. The blue protractor things are gears for moving the arms.

Z Axis

The Z axis is nothing new. Threaded rods in each corner are synchronized by a timing belt and driven by two stepper motors.
